# NurAI – Visual DNA
Version: 1.0

This document defines the visual identity foundations of NurAI.

This is NOT a UI mockup.
This is NOT a branding guideline with logos.

This document defines the *feeling*, *restraint*, and *visual philosophy*
that all UI implementations MUST follow.

---

## 🧠 CORE VISUAL PHILOSOPHY

NurAI should feel like:
- A quiet companion
- A personal notebook
- A calm pause in a noisy phone

NOT like:
- A productivity app
- A gamified tracker
- A flashy Islamic platform

The UI should slow the user down, not speed them up.

---

## 🎨 COLOR PHILOSOPHY (NOT A PALETTE YET)

NurAI colors are:
- Muted
- Natural
- Softly warm
- Low contrast

Avoid:
- Pure white
- Pure black
- Neon or saturated colors
- Obvious “Islamic green”

---

## 🌿 COLOR ROLES (SEMANTIC, NOT HEX)

Colors are defined by *role*, not by exact value.
Exact colors may change, roles MUST NOT.

### 1. Background Base
- Warm off-white
- Slightly textured feeling
- Feels like paper, not glass

Purpose:
- Main screens
- Reading areas

---

### 2. Surface / Card Background
- Slightly darker than background base
- Very subtle contrast
- Cards should blend, not pop

Purpose:
- AyahCard
- ReadingCard
- Soft containers

---

### 3. Primary Text
- Dark gray, not black
- Easy on the eyes
- Optimized for long reading

Purpose:
- Main text
- Ayah meanings
- Explanations

---

### 4. Secondary Text
- Lighter gray
- Clearly subordinate
- Never distracting

Purpose:
- Labels
- Helper text
- Meta information

---

### 5. Accent (Very Limited Use)
- Earthy, desaturated tone
- Used sparingly
- Never dominant

Purpose:
- Subtle highlights
- Important but calm actions

Rule:
Accent color should feel “noticed later”, not “noticed first”.

---

## ✍️ TYPOGRAPHY PHILOSOPHY

Typography is the main identity carrier of NurAI.

### Font Roles (NOT specific font names)

#### 1. Body / UI Font
- Neutral
- Highly readable
- Invisible personality

Used for:
- UI labels
- Buttons
- Explanations
- Navigation

Rule:
If the user notices the font, it is the wrong font.

---

#### 2. Reading / Ayah Font
- Slight serif or humanist feel
- Calm and book-like
- Modern, not classical

Used for:
- Ayah meanings
- Reflections
- Key spiritual text

Rule:
Reading text should feel like a page, not a screen.

---

## 📐 SPACING & LAYOUT PHILOSOPHY

Spacing is more important than color.

Rules:
- Generous vertical spacing
- Fewer elements per screen
- Content should breathe

Avoid:
- Dense layouts
- Tight stacks
- “Fill the screen” mentality

White space is a feature, not empty space.

---

## 🔘 BUTTON & INTERACTION PHILOSOPHY

Buttons should feel:
- Optional
- Light
- Non-demanding

Avoid:
- Aggressive primary buttons
- Bright call-to-action colors
- Large block buttons everywhere

Preferred:
- Text buttons
- Soft outlined buttons
- Calm feedback states

---

## 🌙 MOTION & FEEDBACK (SUBTLE ONLY)

Animations:
- Slow
- Minimal
- Purposeful

Avoid:
- Bounce effects
- Attention-grabbing motion
- Gamified feedback

Feedback should reassure, not excite.

---

## 🚫 EXPLICIT VISUAL NON-GOALS

NurAI MUST NOT:
- Look like a productivity dashboard
- Look like a social app
- Look like a finance app
- Look like a “Ramadan campaign”

No charts.
No streak visuals.
No progress bars that create pressure.

---

## 🧭 FINAL VISUAL PRINCIPLE

If a visual decision creates urgency:
- Remove it

If a visual decision creates calm:
- Keep it

NurAI should visually whisper, not speak loudly.
